/*
To evaluate the last part of the module, we are going to do a final project so that we don't have to do an exam.

Mandatory requirements:

We are going to use the technology JPA/EclipseLink to interact with the database.
The project will have (at least) 2 tables, related between them with a one to many relationship.
The topic of the tables is free (that means that it is not desirable 2 people appearing with the same tables).
We will have a graphic interface, to select, insert, update and delete records (at least from the table marked as "one" in the OneToMany relationship.
With regards to the table marked as "many" in the relationship, you should implement the select functionality of the records related to the one relationship (you could use a JTable or if it is so hard for you, you could use a JTextArea if it is so complicated for you).
You would have make a good code structure.
Optional requirements (to raise your mark):

Research new interface components which can make a richer user interface.
Show messages in a friendly way for the user.
Research about new JPA/EclipseLink features and incorporate them to the project: some examples might be: NamedQueries, custom queries, ManyToMany relationships, lazy/eager load (and SQL log to see the difference), inheritance and different strategies, GeneratedValue, BLOB (for binary objects such as images)...
Paginate the records shown in the table, for example, by showing 10 or 5 records on each page and inserting buttons to go to the next page, previous page...
